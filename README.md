Experimental validation
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, we applied them to over 100 representative geometry problems drawn from secondary school textbooks, national and regional examinations (including the National College Entrance Examination in China), and international mathematical Olympiads. The experimental results show that in more than 90% of the cases, the algebraic forms of NDGs were successfully converted into explicit geometric quantities. This enabled not only the rigorous proof of both the original and converse theorems but also the derivation of extended, generalized versions of the propositions. Notably, more than ten of these extended theorems have been published in journals such as Crux Mathematicorum, serving as valuable resources for both teaching and mathematical research. These outcomes demonstrate the dual potential of our approach in advancing theoretical geometry and enhancing pedagogical practice. Several specific examples are provided below.

It should be noted that, among the more than 100 typical geometry problems tested, the few cases in which transformation failed were primarily due to highly complex given conditions, nonlinear systems arising during the solving process, or excessively complicated algebraic forms of NDGs that fell outside the scope of our geometric quantity candidate library. All symbolic computations were performed using the Mathematica platform. The choice of coordinate system has a significant impact on both the complexity of derived point coordinates and the form of algebraic expressions for geometric quantities. A carefully selected coordinate system can dramatically simplify expressions and enhance their interpretability. Thus, the automatic construction of an "optimal" or "simplest" coordinate system remains an important direction for future research.
Furthermore, the decomposition strategy for geometric theorems and the conversion between complex number expressions and classical geometric quantities may introduce discrepancies in constant coefficients or involve the imaginary unit. To ensure correctness, results should be cross-verified using dynamic geometry software such as GeoGebra. These limitations indicate that the current framework is not yet fully automated and still requires a degree of human insight and intervention.
